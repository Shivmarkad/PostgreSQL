SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;

//LIMIT - clause will limit maximum number of records to return

SELECT * FROM cars

SELECT MIN(age) FROM student;

//MAX() - return largest values with selected column

SELECT MAX(column_name)

WHERE marks >= 80;

//SUM() - return sum of numeric column

//AVG() -  return average of that column

SELECT AVG(numeric_column) from table_name;
