//JOIN - clause used to combine rows from two or more tables

    INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
    LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
    RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
    FULL JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table

//INNER JOIN - Will SELECT only records from left table and right table matching 

SELECT name, age, marks FROM student 
INNER JOIN score_card ON student.student_id = score_card.student_id;

//LEFT JOIN: - WILL SELECT all records from left table and matching records from right table

SELECT name, age, marks 
FROM student 
LEFT JOIN score_card ON student.student_id = score_card.student_id;

//RIGHT JOIN - WILL SELECT all records from right table and matching records from left table

SELECT name, age, marks 
FROM student 
RIGHT JOIN score_card ON student.student_id = score_card.student_id;

//GROUP BY
The GROUP BY clause is used to group together those rows in a table 
that have the same values in all the columns listed.

select name, age, count(student_id) from student GROUP BY name,age order by age;


Result:-

  name  | age | count
--------+-----+-------
 sachin |  21 | 	1
 ravi     |  22 | 	1
 shiv     |  24 | 	1
 Ramesh |  26 | 	1


//HAVING

The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE clause cannot be used with aggregate functions.

select name, age, count(student_id) from student group by name,age HAVING age >22;

Result:

  name  | age | count
--------+-----+-------
 shiv        |  24 | 	 1
 Ramesh |  26 | 	1
